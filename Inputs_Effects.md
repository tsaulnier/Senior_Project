# About:
This document includes a list of inputs from the environment and the audio effect/functions to which they will be mapped. Please add to this document as you see fit!

| Input | Mapping |
|:-------|:---------------|
| Proximity to tag | chord complexity |
| Direction (maybe in rads?) | panning |
| Getting closer/further | mood (major/minor) |
| Target's terrain type | texture/timbre |
| Player's movement speed | tempo |
| ??? | crescendo/decresendo |
| Indoors? | Reverb |
| ??? | Syncopation/delay |
| Underwater | muffled/muted/high-pass |
| Weather condition/astronomical? | ??? |
| Time of day | ??? |

This could sound like sonar from very far, and complex chords/melody when close?
May want to add photo hint within ~50m?
